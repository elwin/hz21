(Introduction)

[INSERT VERY NICE PHRASE]

Hi, We are "bee COOl", and our goal is to encourage people to be more sustainable by taking small actions while shopping.

(Data - problem)

Our survey shows that 90% of the people are concerned about climate change, but only 48% of those think about carbon emissions while shopping. Going green is often associated with great sacrifice or an expensive lifestyle. We are here to show that this must not be true, and going green can actually be affordable. 

(Storytelling and Platform presentation)

Now, meet bee. She's like a pet, and needs to be checked every time you go shopping. You'll make her evolve by simply creating your sustainable shopping list. She shows you how much more you would spend for having greener alternatives of the same or similar products. For every unit of CO2 saved, you can acumulate carboncoins, retrievable with any of our partners. You make Bee Cool by reaching the top in the leaderboard with your friends.

(Business plan)

By partnering up with supermarkets, we offer our service as plugin in their apps, and the data we collect is invaluable for our partners to understand their customers, and how to better serve their needs for greener products. 

We envision a greener customer-supermarket relationship and our service realizes an important step towards that goal.

In the future, we plan to integrate with other sectors including fashion and delivery stores.

Small changes, big impact. Let's all be cool!
